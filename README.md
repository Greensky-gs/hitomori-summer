# Hitomori Summer

This is a bot for an [Hitomori Event](https://discord.gg/UaGjuWYyws)

This is a french server, so the bot is obviously in french

## Usage

Open a command prompt and run this command

```cmd
git clone https://github.com/Greensky-gs/hitomori-summer && cd hitomori-summer && yarn install
```

If you use npm, replace `yarn` by `npm` in the command (and same for `pnpm` of course)

Then you have to create a `.env` file like [`.env.example`](./.env.example)

## Start

Run this command to start the bot

```cmd
yarn install && yarn build && yarn start
```

(Same than earlier, replace `yarn` by `npm` or `pnpm` according to your tool)

## Database

The database is a json file, as the bot is just for a small server for a small event
